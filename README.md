# 🍎🥕 Fruits and Vegetables

## 🤔 Notes and assumptions
* I am starting with the domain as I would organize it for a Grocery shop application.
* Installed https://github.com/webmozarts/assert for nicer assertions
* I focused on some initial design and then tried to do some TDD, continiously refactoring the tests and sometimes - the code itself.

## 🎯 Goal
We want to build a service which will take a `request.json` and:
* Process the file and create two separate collections for `Fruits` and `Vegetables`
* Each collection has methods like `add()`, `remove()`, `list()`;
* Units have to be stored as grams;
* As a bonus you might consider giving option to decide which units are returned (kilograms/grams);
* As a bonus you might consider how to implement `search()` method collections;

### ✔️ How can I check if my code is working?
You have two ways of moving on:
* You call the Service from PHPUnit test like it's done in dummy test (just run `bin/phpunit` from the console)

or

* You create a Controller which will be calling the service with a json payload

## 💡 Hints before you start working on it
* Keep KISS, DRY, YAGNI, SOLID principles in mind
* Timebox your work - we expect that you would spend between 3 and 4 hours.
* Your code should be tested

## When you are finished
* Please upload your code to a public git repository (i.e. GitHub, Gitlab)

## 🐳 Docker image
Optional. Just here if you want to run it isolated.
